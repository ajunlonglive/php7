# a service needs to be restarted before new configuration options are used for example.

- meta: flush_handlers

# Reload local facts
#
# This ensures any Ansible local facts registered by tasks in the current playbook are loaded and so can be tested.

- action: setup

# Atomic tests

# These tests mirror individual tasks to ensure they execute correctly
# E.g. creating a user, installing the right package or generating a valid configuration file
